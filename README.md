# 🥗 NutriScore Predictor: End-to-End ML App 

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=streamlit)](https://junaid-m0hammed-nutriscore-streamlit-aws-app-jjoenj.streamlit.app)

A fully interactive **Streamlit dashboard** that predicts a food item’s **Nutri‑Score (A–E)** based on nutrient values per 100 g. Built as a clean, end-to-end machine learning pipeline — from public food data to model training and deployment.

> 🎯 Real-world use case inspired by food labeling in the EU. Built using `LightGBM`, `Python`, and `Streamlit` with cloud-readiness in mind.


##  Why I Built This

To simulate what real-world food manufacturers or health organizations could use:

- 🔍 Pull, clean, and structure raw food data from OpenFoodFacts
- 📊 Build a regression model to predict nutrition scores
- 🧪 Provide an accessible, transparent frontend for users
- 🧱 Showcase production-grade ML workflow and deployment
